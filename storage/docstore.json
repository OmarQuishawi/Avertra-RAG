electric utility informally called the Power company is a company in the electric power industry (often a public utility) that engages in electricity generation and distribution of electricity for sale generally in a regulated market.[1] The electrical utility industry is a major provider of energy in most countries.\r\n\r\nElectric utilities include investor owned, publicly owned, cooperatives, and nationalized entities. They may be engaged in all or only some aspects of the industry. Electricity markets are also considered electric utilities\u2014these entities buy and sell electricity, acting as brokers, but usually do not own or operate generation, transmission, or distribution facilities. Utilities are regulated by local and national authorities.\r\n\r\nElectric utilities are facing increasing demands[2] including aging infrastructure, reliability, and regulation.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, the French company EDF was the world's largest producer of electricity.[3]\r\n\r\nOrganization\r\nPower transactions\r\nAn electric power system is a group of generation, transmission, distribution, communication, and other facilities that are physically connected.[4] The flow of electricity within the system is maintained and controlled by dispatch centers which can buy and sell electricity based on system requirements.\r\n\r\nExecutive compensation\r\nGlobe icon.\r\nThe examples and perspective in this article may not represent a worldwide view of the subject.

These companies have more political constraints than those in a favorable regulatory environment and are less likely to have a positive response to requests for rate increases.[6]\r\n\r\nJust as increased constraints from regulation drive compensation down for executives in electric utilities, deregulation has been shown to increase remuneration. The need to encourage risk-taking behavior in seeking new investment opportunities while keeping costs under control requires deregulated companies to offer performance-based incentives to their executives.

Public utilities are subject to forms of public control and regulation ranging from local community-based groups to statewide government monopolies.\r\n\r\nPublic utilities are meant to supply goods and services that are considered essential; water, gas, electricity, telephone, waste disposal, and other communication systems represent much of the public utility market. The transmission lines used in the transportation of electricity, or natural gas pipelines, have natural monopoly characteristics. A monopoly can occur when it finds the best way to minimize its costs through economies of scale to the point where other companies cannot compete with it.[1] For example, if many companies are already offering electricity, the additional installation of a power plant will only disadvantage the consumer as prices could be increased. If the infrastructure already exists in a given area, minimal benefit is gained through competing. In other words, these industries are characterized by economies of scale in production.[2] Though it can be mentioned that these natural monopolies are handled or watched by a public utilities commission, or an institution that represents the government.[3]\r\n\r\nThere are many different types of public utilities. Some, especially large companies, offer multiple products, such as electricity and natural gas. Other companies specialize in one specific product, such as water. Modern public utilities may also be partially (or completely) sourced from clean and renewable energy in order to produce sustainable electricity. Of these, wind turbines and solar panels are those used most frequently.\r\n\r\nWhether broadband internet access should be a public utility is a question that was being discussed with the rise of internet usage.

This school of thought holds that the most cost-efficient way of doing business is through a single firm because these are capital-intensive businesses with unusually large economies of scale and high fixed costs associated with building and operating the infrastructure, e.g. power plants, telephone lines and water treatment facilities.[6] However, over the past several decades, traditional public utilities' monopoly position has eroded. For instance, wholesale electricity generation markets, electric transmission networks,[7] electricity retailing and customer choice,[8] telecommunication, some types of public transit and postal services have become competitive in some countries and the trend towards liberalization, deregulation and privatization of public utilities is growing.

By creating, expanding, and improving upon public utilities, a governmental body may attempt to improve its image or attract investment. Traditionally, public services have been provided by public legal entities, which operate much like corporations, but differ in that profit is not necessary for a functional business. A significant factor in government ownership has been to reduce the risk that an activity, if left to private initiative, may be considered not sufficiently profitable and neglected.

By creating, expanding, and improving upon public utilities, a governmental body may attempt to improve its image or attract investment. Traditionally, public services have been provided by public legal entities, which operate much like corporations, but differ in that profit is not necessary for a functional business. A significant factor in government ownership has been to reduce the risk that an activity, if left to private initiative, may be considered not sufficiently profitable and neglected. Many utilities are essential for human life, national defense, or commerce, and the risk of public harm with mismanagement is considerably greater than with other goods. The principle of universality of utilities maintains that these services are best owned by, and operating for, the public. The government and the society itself would like to see these services being economically accessible to all or most of the population.

Consequently, the industry is capital intensive, requiring regular access to the capital markets for external financing. A utility's capital structure may have a significant debt component, which exposes the company to interest rate risk.[14] Should rates rise, the company must offer higher yields to attract bond investors, driving up the utility's interest expenses.

In recent decades several high-profile utility company bankruptcies have challenged this perception.[18]\r\n\r\nMonopoly vs. competition\r\nPublic utilities were historically regarded as natural monopolies because the infrastructure required to produce and deliver a product such as electricity or water is very expensive to build and maintain. Once assets such as power plants or transmission lines are in place, the cost of adding another customer is small, and duplication of facilities would be wasteful.[19] As a result, utilities were either government monopolies, or if investor-owned, regulated by a public utilities commission.[20][21]\r\n\r\nIn the electric utility industry, the monopoly approach began to change in the 1990s.

Public water supply systems are crucial to properly functioning societies. These systems are what supply drinking water to populations around the globe.[1] Aspects of service quality include continuity of supply, water quality and water pressure. The institutional responsibility for water supply is arranged differently in different countries and regions (urban versus rural). It usually includes issues surrounding policy and regulation, service provision and standardization.\r\n\r\nThe cost of supplying water consists, to a very large extent, of fixed costs (capital costs and personnel costs) and only to a small extent of variable costs that depend on the amount of water consumed (mainly energy and chemicals). Almost all service providers in the world charge tariffs to recover part of their costs.\r\n\r\nWater supply is a separate topic from irrigation, the practice and systems of water supply on a larger scale, for a wider variety of purposes, primarily agriculture.\r\nTechnical overview\r\n\r\nEngine room of municipal water works in Toledo, Ohio, 1908\r\nWater supply systems get water from a variety of locations after appropriate treatment, including groundwater (aquifers), surface water (lakes and rivers), and the sea through desalination. The water treatment steps include, in most cases, purification, disinfection through chlorination and sometimes fluoridation. Treated water then either flows by gravity or is pumped to reservoirs, which can be elevated such as water towers or on the ground (for indicators related to the efficiency of drinking water distribution see non-revenue water).

Many people in developing countries receive a poor or very poor quality of service.[4]\r\n\r\nContinuity of supply\r\nContinuity of water supply is taken for granted in most developed countries but is a severe problem in many developing countries, where sometimes water is only provided for a few hours every day or a few days a week; that is, it is intermittent. This is especially problematic for informal settlements, which are often poorly connected to the water supply network and have no means of procuring alternative sources such as private boreholes. It is estimated that about half of the population of developing countries receives water on an intermittent basis.[5]\r\n\r\nWater quality\r\nFurther information: Drinking water \u00a7 Quality, Water quality, and Water treatment\r\nDrinking water quality has a micro-biological and a physico-chemical dimension. There are thousands of parameters of water quality. In public water supply systems water should, at a minimum, be disinfected\u2014most commonly through the use of chlorination or the use of ultraviolet light\u2014or it may need to undergo treatment, especially in the case of surface water.

In poorly managed systems, water pressure can be so low as to result only in a trickle of water or so high that it leads to damage to plumbing fixtures and waste of water. Pressure in an urban water system is typically maintained either by a pressurised water tank serving an urban area, by pumping the water up into a water tower and relying on gravity to maintain a constant pressure in the system or solely by pumps at the water treatment plant and repeater pumping stations.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nTypical UK pressures are 4\u20135 bar (60\u201370 PSI) for an urban supply.[citation needed] However, some people can get over eight bars or below one bar. A single iron main pipe may cross a deep valley, it will have the same nominal pressure, however each consumer will get a bit more or less because of the hydrostatic pressure (about 1 bar/10 m height). So people at the bottom of a 30-metre (100 ft) hill will get about 3 bars more than those at the top.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nThe effective pressure also varies because of the pressure loss due to supply resistance, even for the same static pressure.

Regulatory agencies can be entrusted with a variety of responsibilities, including in particular the approval of tariff increases and the management of sector information systems, including benchmarking systems. Sometimes they also have a mandate to settle complaints by consumers that have not been dealt with satisfactorily by service providers. These specialized entities are expected to be more competent and objective in regulating service providers than departments of government Ministries. Regulatory agencies are supposed to be autonomous from the executive branch of government, but in many countries have often not been able to exercise a great degree of autonomy.\r\n\r\nIn the United States regulatory agencies for utilities have existed for almost a century at the level of states, and in Canada at the level of provinces.

Yet some are being very successful and are modelling the best forms of public management. As Ryutaro Hashimoto, former Japanese Prime Minister, notes: \"Public water services currently provide more than 90 percent of water supply in the world. Modest improvement in public water operators will have immense impact on global provision of services.\"[9]\r\n\r\nGovernance arrangements\r\nGovernance arrangements for both public and private utilities can take many forms (Kurian and McCarney, 2010).[10] Governance arrangements define the relationship between the service provider, its owners, its customers and regulatory entities.

To meet the Millennium Development Goals targets of halving the proportion of the population lacking access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015, current annual investment on the order of US$10 to US$15 billion would need to be roughly doubled. This does not include investments required for the maintenance of existing infrastructure.[19]\r\n\r\nOnce infrastructure is in place, operating water supply and sanitation systems entails significant ongoing costs to cover personnel, energy, chemicals, maintenance and other expenses. The sources of money to meet these capital and operational costs are essentially either user fees, public funds or some combination of the two.[20] It is also important to consider is the flexibility of the water supply system.[21][22]\r\n\r\nMetering\r\nMain article: Water metering\r\n\r\nA typical residential water meter\r\nMetering of water supply is usually motivated by one or several of four objectives.

First, it provides an incentive to conserve water which protects water resources (environmental objective).

Fourth, it allows suppliers to charge for water based on use, which is perceived by many as the fairest way to allocate the costs of water supply to users. Metering is considered good practice in water supply and is widespread in developed countries, except for the United Kingdom. In developing countries it is estimated that half of all urban water supply systems are metered and the tendency is increasing.\r\n\r\nWater meters are read by one of several methods:\r\n\r\nthe water customer writes down the meter reading and mails in a postcard with this info to the water department;\r\nthe water customer writes down the meter reading and uses a phone dial-in system to transfer this info to the water department;\r\nthe water customer logs into the website of the water supply company, enters the address, meter ID and meter readings [3] Archived 28 September 2007 at the Wayback Machine\r\na meter reader comes to the premises and enters the meter reading into a handheld computer;\r\nthe meter reading is echoed on a display unit mounted to the outside of the premises, where a meter reader records them;\r\na small radio is hooked up to the meter to automatically transmit readings to corresponding receivers in handheld computers, utility vehicles or distributed collectors\r\na small computer is hooked up to the meter that can either dial out or receive automated phone calls that give the reading to a central computer system.\r\nMost cities are increasingly installing automatic meter reading (AMR) systems to prevent fraud, to lower ever-increasing labor and liability costs and to improve customer service and satisfaction.", "start_char_idx": 26807, "end_char_idx": 29123, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b521b8a4-9f01-4dee-b20b-cd5a644f0287": {"__data__": {"id_": "b521b8a4-9f01-4dee-b20b-cd5a644f0287", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\LENOVO\\Desktop\\Projects\\Avertra RAG\\data\\water utility.txt", "file_name": "water utility.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 31271, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "28068c8c-9c6e-4ff9-ae72-7fb3e0ba048c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\LENOVO\\Desktop\\Projects\\Avertra RAG\\data\\water utility.txt", "file_name": "water utility.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 31271, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "dd53b6437a00259dc3c68a07ac7e16fcb1667099dc358e107fef79f389fd2ae2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d197fb1d-dfc4-43ea-84d9-86d8459d23e0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "c:\\Users\\LENOVO\\Desktop\\Projects\\Avertra RAG\\data\\water utility.txt", "file_name": "water utility.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 31271, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "bffcd247ef58e1292ad35388ba221279ce328de6b10de6e3bcec57684a624afb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "30d60270-4d68-4a97-9c67-25fb2d1b0a50", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c6f02b7c0b9ea13ffee002da396506b1ec737221e06ec38ac49d0fe84438bde", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Most cities are increasingly installing automatic meter reading (AMR) systems to prevent fraud, to lower ever-increasing labor and liability costs and to improve customer service and satisfaction.\r\n\r\nGlobal access\r\n\r\nWater supplied by a truck in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India\r\n\r\nShipot, a common source of drinking water in Dzyhivka, Ukraine\r\nFurther information: WASH\r\nThis section is an excerpt from Drinking water \u00a7 Global access.[edit]\r\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), \"access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection.\"[23]:\u200a2\u200a In 1990, only 76 percent of the global population had access to drinking water.
